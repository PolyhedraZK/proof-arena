# Proof Arena
Bringing fair and reproduciable benchmarks for ZK.

# Goal
1. Fairness: the most important feature we are providing, benchmarking everything on the same and standard environment.
2. Reproducibility: everyone can reproduce results prenested on the arena using the standard environment.
3. Accessiblity: data are presented in a nice way.
4. Expandibility: we track most recent advancement in the area.
5. Comprehensive: we benchmark all aspects of a proving system.
6. Modernization: we keep updating our hardware. Feel free to submit new hardware requests if you are a hardware company, we are open to install your chip to benchmark.

Clearing the fog of war on zk.
