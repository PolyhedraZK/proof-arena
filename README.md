# Proof Arena
Bringing fair and reproducible benchmarks for Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK).

## Goals
1. **Fairness:** Ensuring all benchmarks are conducted in the same standardized environment.
2. **Reproducibility:** Allowing everyone to replicate the results presented in the arena using the standard environment.
3. **Accessibility:** Presenting data in an easy-to-understand manner.
4. **Expandability:** Tracking the latest advancements in the field.
5. **Comprehensiveness:** Benchmarking all aspects of a proving system.
6. **Modernization:** Regularly updating our hardware. Hardware companies are welcome to submit new hardware requests; we are open to installing your chip for benchmarking.

Clearing the fog of war on ZK.
