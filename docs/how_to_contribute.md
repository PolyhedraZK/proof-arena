Proof Arena is an open platform for benchmarking zero-knowledge (ZK) algorithms, and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're interested in proposing a new problem or contributing a solution, this guide will walk you through the updated process.

## How to Contribute a Problem

Contributing a problem allows you to define new challenges for benchmarking ZK algorithms. Follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the [Proof Arena GitHub repository](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/proof-arena) to your GitHub account.

2. **Create a New Problem Directory**:

   - Navigate to the `problems` directory.
   - Create a new directory with a descriptive name for your problem.
   - Inside this directory, create a `problem.md` file with the following header format:

     ```yaml
     ---
     problem_id: [Unique Problem ID]
     title: [Problem Title]
     description: [Brief Description]
     draft: false
     enable_comments: true
     proposer: [Your Name or Organization]
     proposer_icon: [Path to Your Icon (24x24)]
     ---
     ```

   - Fill in the header with appropriate information.
   - Write a detailed problem description in Markdown format, including:

     - **Problem Description**: Detailed explanation with background information.
     - **Interaction Instructions**: How the prover should interact with the Special Judge Program (SPJ).
     - **Test Vectors**: Example inputs and expected outputs.
     - **References**: Any relevant links or materials.

   - Write a Special Judge Program (SPJ) to interact with the prover. The SPJ will provide inputs, check outputs, and invoke the verifier. Refer to our [sample SPJ code](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/proof-arena/tree/main/problems/keccak256_hash/SPJ).

3. **Submit a Pull Request**:

   - Commit your changes to your forked repository.
   - Open a Pull Request (PR) to the main Proof Arena repository with a clear explanation of your problem.

4. **Community Review**:

   - Your submission will be reviewed by the community and maintainers.
   - Address any feedback during the review process.

5. **Approval and Integration**:

   - Once approved, your problem will be merged and made available on the platform.

## How to Contribute a Solution

Contributing a solution involves submitting a prover that can solve a problem listed on Proof Arena. Follow these steps:

1. **Select a Problem**:

   - Visit the [Proof Arena website](https://proofarena.org) and choose a problem to solve.
   - Ensure you understand the problem's requirements and constraints.

2. **Prepare Your Prover**:

   - Fork the [Proof Arena GitHub repository](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/proof-arena) to your GitHub account.
   - Implement your prover algorithm, meeting the API standards specified in the SPJ and [Proof Arena GitHub repository](https://github.com/PolyhedraZK/proof-arena).
   - Submitting source code is optional but encouraged for transparency.
   - **Verifier Code**: Submitting your verifier code is mandatory for auditing.

3. **Local Testing**:

   - Test your prover locally with provided test vectors.
   - Ensure your prover meets performance requirements.

4. **Submit Your Prover**:

   - Create a directory for your prover at `problems/[PROBLEM_NAME]/[YOUR_PROVER_NAME]` in your forked repository.
   - Include all necessary files: binaries, verifier code, and documentation.

5. **Trigger Judgement Process**:

   - To trigger the judgement process, start with a specific script path in your pull request message:

     ```
     [script:problems/[PROBLEM_NAME]/[YOUR_PROVER_NAME]/run.sh]
     ```

     For example:

     ```
     [script:problems/keccak256_hash/my_prover/run.sh]
     ```

     If you are ready for review, add `SUBMISSION_READY` to the end of your commit message:

     For example:

     ```
     [script:problems/[PROBLEM_NAME]/[YOUR_PROVER_NAME]/run.sh] SUBMISSION_READY
     ```

6. **CI Execution**:

   - The CI will execute the specified script to automate testing and verification.
   - Ensure your script is executable and located at the specified path.

7. **Automatic Pull Request Creation**:

   - If your prover runs successfully and generates updates in the `spj_output/` directory, the CI will automatically create a Pull Request with the results.

8. **Review and Merge**:

   - Maintainers will review the PR generated by the CI.
   - Address any feedback or required changes.
   - Once approved, your solution will be merged and displayed on the platform.

## Notes

- **Code Formatting**: When including code in your submissions, ensure clean code blocks without line numbers or prefixes. For example:

  ```go
  func main() {
      fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
  }
  ```

- **CI Requirements**:

  - The CI workflow looks for the script path in the commit message to determine whether to execute your prover.
  - If the script path is not provided or incorrect, the CI will terminate gracefully without executing your prover.
  - Ensure your script is executable and compatible with the CI environment.

- **Branching and Permissions**:

  - You may not have permission to push directly to the main branch.
  - All changes should be submitted via Pull Requests and will be reviewed before merging.

- **Feedback Loop**:

  - If you encounter issues with the CI process or need assistance, feel free to comment in your Pull Request.
  - Engage with maintainers and the community for support.
