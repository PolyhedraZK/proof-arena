# Fibonacci Sequence in zkVM

## Problem Description

In this problem, your task is to implement a Fibonacci sequence calculator within a Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine (zkVM). The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

Your zkVM implementation should be able to calculate the nth Fibonacci number, where n is provided as input. This problem will test your ability to work with zkVMs and implement basic arithmetic operations and control flow within the constraints of a zero-knowledge environment.

## Input

The input will be a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 50), representing the position in the Fibonacci sequence for which you need to calculate the value.

## Output

Your program should output a single integer, which is the nth Fibonacci number.

## Example

Input: 10
Output: 55

Explanation: The 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 55. The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

## Implementation Details

1. You must implement this solution within a zkVM of your choice (e.g., RISC Zero, Polygon zkEVM, Cairo VM).
2. Your implementation should be efficient and consider the constraints of the zkVM environment.
3. Provide clear documentation on how to run your solution, including any setup required for the chosen zkVM.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

1. Correctness: The program must correctly calculate Fibonacci numbers.
2. Efficiency: The implementation should be optimized for the zkVM environment.
3. Code quality: Clear, well-documented code is expected.
4. Zero-knowledge considerations: Your solution should demonstrate an understanding of zkVM constraints and capabilities.

## Submission Guidelines

Please submit your solution as a complete project, including:

1. Source code for the zkVM implementation
2. A README file with clear instructions on how to run your solution
3. Any additional documentation explaining your approach and design decisions

Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your innovative solutions!
